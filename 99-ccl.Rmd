# Conclusions

As a summary, analysing an RNA-Seq experiment entails:

1. Processing the raw data: QC, trimming, alignment and counting (see
   chapter \@ref(sec-hts)).
2. Constructing the count matrix and the sample annotation (see
   section \@ref(sec-counts) and/or chapter \@ref(sec-se)).
3. Run a `DESeq2` analysis (see chapter \@ref(sec-rnaseq)).
4. Perform an enrichment analysis (see chapter \@ref(sec-gsea)).
