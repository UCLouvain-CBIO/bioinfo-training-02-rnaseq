# Unsupervised learning: dimensionality reduction {#sec-dimred}

## Introduction

In this chapter, we are going to learn about dimensionality reduction,
also called ordination. The goal of dimensionality reduction is to
transform a high-dimensional data into data of lesser dimensions while
minimising the loss of information.

Dimensionality reduction is used as a data transformation technique
for input to other machine learning methods such as classifications,
or as a very efficient visualisation technique, which is the use case
we will focus on here. We are going to focus on a widerly used method
called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).


```{r pcaexdata, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("rWSBIM1322")
data(xy)
```

We are going to use the following dataset to illustrate some important
concepts that are scale and central to PCA. The small dataset show
below represents the measurement of genes *x* and *y* in 20
samples. We will be using the scaled and centred version of this data.

```{r xyplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Raw (left) and scale/centred (right) expression data for genes *x* and *y* in 20 samples", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 11}
library("ggplot2")
library("patchwork")

## original data
p0 <- ggplot(xy0, aes(x = gene_x, y = gene_y)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3)

## scaled data
p <- ggplot(xy, aes(x = gene_x, y = gene_y)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3)

p0 + p
```

## Lower-dimensional projections

The goal of dimensionality reduction is to reduce the number of
dimensions in a way that the new data remains useful. One way to
reduce a 2-dimensional data is by projecting the data onto a
lines. Below, we project our data on the x and y axes. These are
called **linear projections**.

```{r linproj, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Projection of the data on the x (left) and y (right) axes.", fig.heigth = 5, fig.width = 11}

## projection on y = 0
py <- p +
    geom_point(aes(y = 0), colour = "red") +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = gene_x, yend = 0), linetype = "dashed")

## projection on x = 0
px <- p +
    geom_point(aes(x = 0), colour = "red") +
    geom_segment(aes(yend = gene_y, xend = 0), linetype = "dashed")

## projections on x = 0 and y = 0
py + px
```

In general, and in particular in the projections above, we lose
information when reducing the number of dimensions (above, from 2
(plane) to 1 (line)). In the first example above (left), we lose all
the measurements of gene *y*. In the second example (right), we lose
all the measurements of gene *x*.

The goal of dimensionality reduction is to limit this loss.

We know already about **linear regression**. Below, we use the `lm`
function to regress *y* onto *x* (left) and *x* onto *y*
(right). These regression lines give us an approximate linear
relationship between the expression of genes *x* and *y*. The
relationship differs depending on which gene we choose to be the
predictor and the response.


```{r linreg, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Regression of y onto x (left) minimisises the sums of squares of vertical residuals (red). Regression of x onto y (right) minimisises the sums of squares of horizontal residuals (orange).", fig.width = 5, fig.width = 11}
reg1 <- lm(gene_y ~ gene_x, data = xy)
a1 <- reg1$coefficients[1] # intercept
b1 <- reg1$coefficients[2] # slope
pline1 <- p +
    geom_abline(intercept = a1, slope = b1, col = "blue", lwd = 1.5) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = gene_x, yend = reg1$fitted),
                 colour = "red",
                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm")))

reg2 <- lm(gene_x ~ gene_y, data = xy)
a2 <- reg2$coefficients[1] # intercept
b2 <- reg2$coefficients[2] # slope
pline2 <- p +
    geom_abline(intercept = -a2/b2, slope = 1/b2,
                col = "blue", lwd = 1.5) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = reg2$fitted, yend = gene_y),
                 colour = "orange",
                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm")))

pline1 + pline2
```

We now want a line that minimises distances in both directions, as
shown below. This line, called **principal component**, is also the
ones that maximises the variance of the projections along itself.

```{r pxaex, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The first prinicpal component minimises the sum of squares of the orthogonal projections.", fig.height = 5.6, fig.width = 11.5}
svda <- svd(xy)
pc <- as.matrix(xy) %*% svda$v[, 1] %*% t(svda$v[, 1])
bp <- svda$v[2, 1] / svda$v[1, 1]
ap <- mean(pc[, 2]) - bp * mean(pc[, 1])
pline3 <- p +
    geom_segment(xend = pc[, 1], yend = pc[, 2]) +
    geom_abline(intercept = ap, slope = bp,
                col = "purple", lwd = 1.5)

ppdf <- tibble(PC1n = -svda$u[, 1] * svda$d[1],
               PC2n = svda$u[, 2] * svda$d[2])

pca <- ggplot(ppdf, aes(x = PC1n, y = PC2n)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +
    xlab("PC1 ") + ylab("PC2") +
    geom_point(aes(x = PC1n, y = 0), color = "red") +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = PC1n, yend = 0)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "purple",
               lwd=1.5)

pline3 + pca
```

The second principal component is then chosen to be orthogonal to the
first one. In our case above, there is only one possibility.


```{r pxaex2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The second prinicpal component is orthogonal to the second one.", fig.height = 5.8, fig.width = 11}
pca2 <- ggplot(ppdf, aes(x = PC1n, y = PC2n)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +
    xlab("PC1 ") + ylab("PC2") +
    geom_point(aes(x = PC1n, y = 0), color = "red") +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = PC1n, yend = 0), linetype = "dotted") +
    geom_segment(aes(x = PC1n, xend = 0, y = PC2n, yend = PC2n)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "purple",
               lwd=1) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "purple",
               lwd=1.5)

pca + pca2
```

```{r prcomp, echo = FALSE}
.pca <- prcomp(xy)
var <- .pca$sdev^2
pve <- var/sum(var)
```
In the example above the variance, the variance along the PCs are
`r round(var[1], 2)` and `r round(var[2], 2)`. The first one explains
`r round(pve[1] * 100, 1)`% or that variance, and the second one merely
`r round(pve[2] * 100, 1)`%. This is also reflected in the different
scales along the x and y axis.

To account for these differences in variation along the different PCs,
it is better to represent a PCA plot as a rectangle, using an aspect
ratio that is illustrative of the respective variances.

```{r pxaex3, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Final principal component analysis of the data.", fig.height = 2, fig.width = 10}
pca_final <- pca2 <- ggplot(ppdf, aes(x = PC1n, y = PC2n)) +
    geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +
    xlab("PC1 ") + ylab("PC2")
    ## geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
    ## geom_vline(xintercept = 0)
pca_final
```


## The new linear combinations

Principal components are linear combinations of the variables that
were originally measured, they provide a new coordinate system. The
PC in the previous example is a linear combination of *gene_x* and
*gene_y*, more specifically

$$ PC = c_{1} ~ gene_{x} + c_{2} ~ gene_{y} $$

It has coefficients $(c_1, c_2)$, also called loading.

PCA in general will find linear combinations of the original
variables. These new linear combinations will maximise the variance
of the data.

## Summary and application

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique that transforms the
original n-dimensional data into a new  space.

- These new dimensions are linear combinations of the original data,
  i.e.  they are composed of proportions of the original variables.

- Along these new dimensions, called principal components, the data
  expresses most of its variability along the first PC, then second,
  ...

- Principal components are orthogonal to each other,
  i.e. non-correlated.


```{r pcaex, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Original data (left). PC1 will maximise the variability while minimising the residuals (centre). PC2 is orthogonal to PC1 (right).", fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
pca <- prcomp(xy)
z <- cbind(x = c(-1, 1), y = c(0, 0))
zhat <- z %*% t(pca$rotation[, 1:2])
zhat <- scale(zhat, center = colMeans(xy), scale = FALSE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(xy, main = "Orignal data (2 dimensions)")
plot(xy, main = "Orignal data with PC1")
abline(lm(gene_y ~ gene_x, data = data.frame(zhat - 10)), lty = "dashed")
grid()
plot(pca$x, main = "Data in PCA space", ylim = c(-2, 2))
grid()
```

In R, we can use the `prcomp` function. A summary of the `prcomp`
output shows that along PC1, we are able to retain close to 92%
of the total variability in the data.


```{r pcaxy}
library("rWSBIM1322")
data(xy)
pca_xy <- prcomp(xy)
summary(pca_xy)
```

This `pca_xy` variable is an object of class `prcomp`. To learn what
it contains, we can look at its structure with `str` and read the
`?prcomp` manual page.

```{r}
str(pca_xy)
```

We are going to focus on two elements:

- **sdev** contains the standard deviations along the respective PCs
  (as also displayed in the summary). From these, we can compute the
  variances, the percentages of variance explained by the individual
  PCs, and the cumulative variances.

```{r pcavar}
(var <- pca_xy$sdev^2)
(pve <- var/sum(var))
cumsum(pve)
```

- **x** contains the coordinates of the data along the PCs. These are
  the values we could use to produce the PCA plot as above by hand.

```{r pcaplot, fig.cap = ""}
pca_xy$x
plot(pca_xy$x)
```


## Visualisation

A **biplot** features all original points re-mapped (rotated) along the
first two PCs as well as the original features as vectors along the
same PCs. Feature vectors that are in the same direction in PC space
are also correlated in the original data space.

```{r biplot, fig.cap = "A biplot shows both the variables (arrows) and observations of the PCA analysis."}
biplot(pca_xy)
```

One important piece of information when using PCA is the proportion of
variance explained along the PCs (see above), in particular when
dealing with high dimensional data, as PC1 and PC2 (that are generally
used for visualisation), might only account for an insufficient
proportion of variance to be relevant on their own. This can be
visualised on a **screeplot**, that can be produced with

```{r screeplot, fig.cap = "Screeplot showing the variances for the PCs."}
plot(pca_xy)
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Repeat the analysis above with the `xy0` data, that you can load
from the `rWSBIM1322` data. First scale it, then repeat the PCA
analysis as shown above.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r pcaex1, fig.cap = ""}
xy <- scale(xy0)
pca1 <- prcomp(xy)
summary(pca1)
screeplot(pca1)
biplot(pca1)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Load the `cptac_prot` data[^msnset1], scale the data (see below for
why scaling is important), then perform the PCA analysis and interpret
it. Also produce a PCA for PCs 2 and 3.

[^msnset1]: The [`MSnSet`
    class](https://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/reference/MSnSet-class.html)
    (defined in the `MSnbase` package) is similar to
    `SummarizedExperiment`, that we have seen in detail in chapter
    \@ref(sec-obj). You can convert an `MSnSet` object to a
    `SummarizedExperiment` with `as(x, "SummarizexExperiment")`.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r pcaex2, fig.cap = ""}
library("MSnbase")
data(cptac_prot)
x <- scale(exprs(cptac_prot))
pca2 <- prcomp(x)
summary(pca2)
screeplot(pca2)
biplot(pca2)
plot(pca2$x[, 2:3])
biplot(pca2, choices = 2:3)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
In the exercise above, the PCA was performed on the features
(proteins). Transpose the data and produce a PCA of the
samples. Interprete the figures.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r, warning = FALSE}
x_t <- t(x)
pca3 <- prcomp(x_t)
summary(pca3)
screeplot(pca3)
biplot(pca3)
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


## Pre-processing and missing values with PCA

We haven't looked at other `prcomp` parameters, other that the first
one, `x`. There are two other ones that are or importance, in
particular in the light of the section on pre-processing above, which
are `center` and `scale.`. The former is set to `TRUE` by default,
while the second one is set the `FALSE`.


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Perform a PCA analysis on the `mtcars` dataset with and without
scaling. Compare and interpret the results.

`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`

```{r scalepcasol, fig.with=12, fig.cap=""}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
biplot(prcomp(mtcars, scale = FALSE), main = "No scaling")  ## 1
biplot(prcomp(mtcars, scale = TRUE), main = "With scaling") ## 2
```

Without scaling, `disp` and `hp` are the features with the highest
loadings along PC1 and 2 (all others are negligible), which are also
those with the highest units of measurement. Scaling removes this
effect.

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

Real datasets often come with *missing values*. In R, these should be
encoded using `NA`. Unfortunately, PCA cannot deal with missing
values, and observations containing `NA` values will be dropped
automatically. This is a viable solution only when the proportion of
missing values is low. Otherwise, it is possible to impute missing
values (which often requires great care) or use an implementation of
PCA such as *non-linear iterative partial least squares* (NIPALS),
that support missing values.

Finally, we should be careful when using categorical data in any of
the unsupervised methods. Categories are generally represented as
factors, which are encoded as integer levels, and might give the
impression that a distance between levels is a relevant measure (which
it is not, unless the factors are ordered). In such situations,
categorical data can be dropped, or it is possible to encode
categories as binary *dummy variables*. For example, if we have 3
categories, say `A`, `B` and `C`, we would create two dummy variables
to encode the categories as:

```{r dummvar, echo=FALSE}
dfr <- data.frame(x = c(1, 0, 0),
                  y = c(0, 1, 0))
rownames(dfr) <- LETTERS[1:3]
dfr
```

so that the distance between each category are approximately equal to 1.

## The full PCA workflow

In this section, we will describe the detailed PCA analysis and
interpretation of two real-life proteomics datasets. Both of these
datasets are available in the `pRolocdata` package.


### Extra-embryonic endoderm differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells {#sec-dimred01}

We are first going to focus on the data from Mulvey *et al.* (2015),
where they present the *Dynamic proteomic profiling of extra-embryonic
endoderm differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells* [@Mulvey:2015].

> During mammalian preimplantation development, the cells of the
> blastocyst's inner cell mass differentiate into the epiblast and
> primitive endoderm lineages, which give rise to the fetus and
> extra-embryonic tissues, respectively. Extra-embryonic endoderm
> (XEN) differentiation can be modeled in vitro by induced
> expression of GATA transcription factors in mouse embryonic stem
> cells. Here, we use this GATA-inducible system to quantitatively
> monitor the dynamics of global proteomic changes during the early
> stages of this differentiation event and also investigate the
> fully differentiated phenotype, as represented by embryo-derived
> XEN cells. Using mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic
> profiling with multivariate data analysis tools, we reproducibly
> quantified 2,336 proteins across three biological replicates and
> have identified clusters of proteins characterized by distinct,
> dynamic temporal abundance profiles. We first used this approach
> to highlight novel marker candidates of the pluripotent state and
> XEN differentiation. Through functional annotation enrichment
> analysis, we have shown that the downregulation of
> chromatin-modifying enzymes, the reorganization of membrane
> trafficking machinery, and the breakdown of cell-cell adhesion are
> successive steps of the extra-embryonic differentiation process.
> Thus, applying a range of sophisticated clustering approaches to a
> time-resolved proteomic dataset has allowed the elucidation of
> complex biological processes which characterize stem cell
> differentiation and could establish a general paradigm for the
> investigation of these processes.


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Load the `mulvey2015` data from the `pRolocdata` package. The data
comes as an object of class `MSnSet`[^msnset2], which you can convert to a

experimental design stored in the *colData* slot.

[^msnset2]: The [`MSnSet`
    class](https://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/reference/MSnSet-class.html)
    is similar to the `SummarizedExperiment` class, that we have seen
    in detail in chapter \@ref(sec-obj).

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

Here, we will want to do a PCA analysis on the samples. We want to remap the
`r ncol(mulvey2015)` samples from a `r nrow(mulvey2015)`-dimensional space into 2, or
possibly 3 dimensions. This will require to transpose the data matrix
before passing it to the `prcomp` function.

### A map of the mouse pluripotent stem cell spatial proteome  {#sec-dimred02}

In this section, we are going to use PCA to explore spatial map of
mouse pluripotent stem cell by Christoforou *et al.*

  function to focus on the variables (the columns of the original
  input).

- Interpret the variables on the biplot. Which ones are correlated? Is
  this to be expected in the light of the experimental design.

- Use the `fviz_pca_ind` function to focus on the individuals (the
  rows of the orgininal input). Use the `habillage` argument of the
  `fviz_pca_ind` function to highlight sub-cellular locations of the
  proteins (use the `"markers"` feature variable) and set the `geom`
  argument to `"point"` to drop the feature names from the plot (which
  correspond to `geom = "text"`). Interpret the figures in the light of
  the spatial proteomics experiment.

Professor Simpson and her team wanted to test the effect of drug A and
drug B on fibroblast. They measured gene expression using RNA-Seq in
three conditions: a control without any drug, cells in presence of
drug A, and cells in presence of drug B. Each of these were measured
in triplicates in a single batch by the same operator.

The figure below shows the PCA plot of the 9 samples, coloured by
condition. Interpreted the figure in the light of the experimentally
design and suggest how to best analyse these data.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "PCA analysis illustrating the global effect of drug A and B."}
library("factoextra")
library("pRolocdata")
data(mulvey2015)
x <- mulvey2015[, mulvey2015$times %in% c(1, 2, 6)]
sampleNames(x) <-  paste(c("CTRL", "DrugA", "DrugB"),
                         rep(1:3, each = 3))
x$grp <- sub("[1-3]", "", sampleNames(x))
p <- prcomp(t(exprs(x)), scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)
fviz_pca_ind(p, habillage = x$grp)

Consider the same experimental design as above, but with the PCA plot
below. Interpret the figure in the light of the experimental design
and suggest how to best analyse these data.

Researchers of the famous FLVIT (Fosse-La-Ville Institute of
Technology) wanted to test the effect of a newly identified
anti-cancer drug C121 on KEK293 cells. They measured proteins
expression using quantitative mass spectrometry in these two
conditions and 4 replicates. Each of these were measured in
triplicates in a single batch.

Interpret the PCA plot in the light of the experimental design. Do you
think the analysis is likely to provide significant results?


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Quantitative proteomics experiment measuring the effect of drug C121."}
x <- mulvey2015[, mulvey2015$times %in% c(1, 3)]
sampleNames(x) <-  paste0(c("CTRL.", "C121."),
                          rep(1:3, each = 2))
x$grp <- sub("\\.[1-3]", "", sampleNames(x))
p <- prcomp(t(exprs(x)), scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)
fviz_pca_ind(p, habillage = x$grp)

In the following experimental design, clinicians have used
quantitative PCR to measure the expression of 96 micro RNAs in the
blood of three patients and three healthy donor, with the goal of
identifying novel biomarkers.

In the light of the experimental design, interpret the PCA plot. What
are the chances to find good biomarkers?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Quantitative proteomics experiment measuring the effect of drug C121."}
x <- mulvey2015[, mulvey2015$rep == 1]
set.seed(123)
exprs(x) <- exprs(x) + rnorm(prod(dim(x)), 1, 1)
sampleNames(x) <-  c("DONOR1", "DONOR2", "PATIENT2", "PATIENT1", "PATIENT3", "DONOR3")
x$grp <- sub("[1-3]", "", sampleNames(x))
p <- prcomp(t(exprs(x)), scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)
fviz_pca_ind(p, habillage = x$grp)

The team of Professor Von der Brille have quantified the gene
expression of Jurkat cells using two RNA-Seq protocols. 25 samples
were tested with kit 1 by operator A and B (12 and 13 samples
respectively), and 27 samples were processed with kit 2 by operators A
and C (20 and 7 samples respectively).


In the light of the experimental design, interpret the PCA plot. What
would you suggest to do before testing whether using kit 1 and 2 have
an impact on the data?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Testing the effect of RNA sequencing kits 1 and 2."}
x <- cbind(matrix(rnorm(1000 * (25 + 26)), nrow = 1000),
           rnorm(1000, 3, 1))
colnames(x) <- c(paste0("kit1.", 1:25),
                 paste0("kit2.", 1:27))
p <- prcomp(t(x))
fviz_pca_ind(p, habillage = sub("\\.[0-9]+$", "", colnames(x)))
```
