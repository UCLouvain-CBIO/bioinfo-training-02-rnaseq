# Preamble {-}

The main objective of this course is to demonstrate how to proceed
with a complete analysis of RNA-seq data, including principal
component analysis, identification of differentially expressed genes
and gene set enrichment and over-representation analysis.

The background for these analyses inludes introductions to hypthesis
testing, linear modelling and adjustment for multiple comparisons,
principal component analysis and high throughtput sequencing.

This course is based on material from the
[WSBIM1322](http://bit.ly/WSBIM1322) and
[WSBIM2122](http://bit.ly/WSBIM2122) chapters taught at the [Faculty
of Pharmacy and Biomedical
Sciences](https://uclouvain.be/en/faculties/fasb) at the UCLouvain.

## Installation instructions {-}

```{r install, eval=FALSE}

pks <- c("tidyverse", "patchwork",
         "SummarizedExperiment", "DESeq2",
         "patchwork", "biomaRt",
         "org.Hs.eg.db", "GO.db",
         "org.Hs.eg.db", "msigdbr",
         "clusterProfiler", "airway",
         "UCLouvain-CBIO/rWSBIM2122",
         "UCLouvain-CBIO/rWSBIM1322")

if (!require("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(pks)
```

## Data preparation  {-}

To prepare soem of the data needed in this course, run
`rWSBIM2122::prepare_shell()` as shown below:


```{r unlink_wsbim2122_data, echo = FALSE}
unlink("wsbim2122_data", recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare_shell}
rWSBIM2122::prepare_shell()
```

The function creates a new directory called `wsbim2122_data`
containing the following sub-directories:

```{r show_prepare_shell}
dir("wsbim2122_data")
```
